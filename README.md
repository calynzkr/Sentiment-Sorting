# Sentiment-Sorting
# I first merged all the results from our group members into one single pdf profile
# I downloaded all the results into one single file on my computer, since all of the results are named in the pattern with company*.csv, I used that to merge the files into one
# Then I performed sentiment analysis on that file and achived best 10 and worst 10 companies
# The last, I extracted the Purpose column from the file and used counter to find the top four most used words
